      <h1>1. Coffee Can Make You Smarter</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Coffee doesn't just keep you awake â€” it may also make you smarter.</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">The active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, which is a stimulant and the most commonly consumed psychoactive substancein the world.</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Caffeine works in your brain by blocking the effects of an inhibitory neurotransmitter called adenosine</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">By blocking the inhibitory effects of adenosine, caffeine actually increases neuronal firing in the brain and the release of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Many controlled studies have examined the effects of caffeine on the brain, demonstrating that caffeine can temporarily improve mood, reaction time, memory, vigilance and general brain function.</p>

      <h1>2. Coffee Can Help You Burn Fat and Improves Physical Performance</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">There's a good reason why you will find caffeine in most commercial fat-burning supplements.</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Caffeine, partly due to its stimulant effect on the central nervous system, both raises metabolism and increases the
      oxidation of fatty acids.</p>

      <p class = "coffeefacts"> class = "coffeefacts"It can also improve athletic performance in several ways, including by mobilizing fatty acids from the fat tissues.</p>

      <p class = "coffeefacts">In two separate meta-analyses, caffeine was found to increase exercise performance by 11-12%, on average.</p>
      <br>

      <h1>3. Coffee May Drastically Lower Your Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-related disease that has reached epidemic proportions. It has increased 10-fold in a few
      decades and now afflicts about 300 million people.</p>
      
      <p class = "coffeefacts">This disease is characterized by high blood glucose levels due to insulin resistance or an inability to produce insulin.</p>

      <p class = "coffeefacts"> class = "coffeefacts"In observational studies, coffee has been repeatedly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The reduction in
      risk ranges from 23% all the way up to 67%.</p>

      <p class = "coffeefacts">A massive review article looked at 18 studies with a total of 457,922 participants. Each additional cup of coffee per
      day lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes by 7%. The more coffee people drank, the lower their risk was.</p>

      <h1>1. Coffee For Kids, May Increase Bedwetting</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">One survey reported that caffeine consumption of 5-7 year old kids may increase enuresis a.k.a. bedwetting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>2. Coffee Can Cause Insomnia And Restlessness</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Again, it's the caffeine working here. Your recommended maximum amount of caffeine is 400 milligrams, roughly the amount
      that you'll get from 4 cups of coffee. If you're caffeine-sensitive, be careful with coffee. You are probably already
      aware what amount and what kind of coffee suits, or doesn't suit you. The amount of caffeine that is safe for human
      consumption is actually written in our DNA.

    <div>
      <h1>3. Coffee Can Kill You</h1>
      <br>
      <p class = "coffeefacts">Yes, if you drink 80-100 cups (23 litres) in a short session. This dose is lethal and will amount in 10-13 grams of
      caffeine within your body. Before you reach this point, however, you'll be vomiting most of it out since 23 litres of
      any liquid is a lot. Even drinking 23 litres of water can kill you.
